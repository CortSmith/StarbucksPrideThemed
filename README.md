# Starbucks Pride Themed 3D Model

This project was commissioned to me by my General Manager during my employment at Starbucks. He had an idea to dedicate a store in the district to a Pride theme and needed help visualizing it. Here is the final result.

## Progress

Below, you will find progress images from beginning to end showcasing some designs that never made it to the final result.

### Challenges

A couple of challenges I ran into during the process of creating this Starbucks:
The first challenge came to me at the start of the project, I couldn't find a floorplan anywhere online with which I had to start from a clean slate and build the store from the ground up. I came up with a strategy to get a near-to-scale model of the store by creating the table I was sitting at to use as my virtual ruler for measuring distance, and then I was able to build out the booth, the bathrooms, and then the walls and ceiling.
The second challenge was decorating, and me not being a very decor savvy person, had to apply Pride-themed decor while maintaining the Starbucks feel. The last progress image showcases this exact thing in comparison with the final result.
